# Prework - peekaboo!

Submitted by: Arti Gnanasekar

peekaboo! is a game that implements the "Where's Waldo?" aspect of finding hidden elements within an art piece. I want to be able to showcase my artwork and creative design with developing an app/game. There should be moving elements within the artwork that help hide the 30 or so images/characters/objects that the player needs to find. 

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

There are several games on the App Store, like soupsoup or hidden figures, where players search for hidden objects shown at the bottom of the screen. I find these games incredibly fun and engaging, but I feel they lack the level of interactivity I’m looking for. I want to enhance this concept by incorporating more dynamic elements, such as opening doors or windows to uncover hidden items. Additionally, I’d like to introduce a shifting artwork environment—for example, transitioning from day to night as players progress through a level. This would add a layer of challenge, with certain objects only visible at specific times.

In the long term, I envision expanding the game into a virtual reality experience. Players could wear a headset and explore a fully immersive 360-degree artwork, actively turning around to discover hidden elements while retaining the same interactive features.

I’m also deeply inspired by The nyt (new york times) games, particularly strands (beta) and the mini crossword. Taking inspiration from their thematic and intellectual design, I’d like each hidden object in my game to align with an underlying theme that ties the artwork together. To add a puzzle-solving twist, each object could come with a riddle-like hint, allowing players to locate it through observation or by deciphering the clue. This would make the gameplay more engaging, encourage critical thinking, and attract a broader audience, ensuring the experience feels vibrant and dynamic rather than stationary or repetitive.

## Notes

This will be the first app I develop, so I’m expecting challenges along the way, but I’m excited about diving into the process and learning as I go. I anticipate that the most challenging aspects will be implementing the moving elements in the artwork, recognizing user clicks accurately, and creating a smooth scrolling experience within the app. Additionally, since I want to incorporate my own artwork into the game, developing and refining those visual elements will be another rewarding yet demanding part of the journey. Despite the challenges, I’m confident it will be a fun and fulfilling project that brings both my technical and creative skills to life.
