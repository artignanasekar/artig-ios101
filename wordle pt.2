# Project 2 - wordle pt.2

Submitted by: arti gnanasekar

wordle is a game developed from new york times where users guess a word from color and position cues. the hw assignment made us do a twist for it by adjusting the length of the word, the number of rows which is dependent on the number of rows of the game as well as choosing a word from a specific category like animals, etc.

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
