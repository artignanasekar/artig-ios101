Worlde is an app that I have to finish. I need to implement a QWERTY keyboard, import sample randomized word, change the scale of the boxes as you input letters, and show which letters are in the randomised word.

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [ ] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [ ] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [ ] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I was a little confused in Exercise 6 where I had to reset the code because I interpreted it as I delete the value as well as reset the box, but I didn't necessarily have to reset the box. So I had a lot of code written there, but after I fully understood the prompt I realized that it was only one line of code at the end of the day.
